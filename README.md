# CodeClause_Hand-Written-Digit-Recognization
This GitHub project focuses on implementing and deploying a Handwritten Digit Recognition system using machine learning techniques. The primary goal of this project is to accurately classify handwritten digits (0 to 9) into their respective numerical values
Project Features:

Dataset: The project utilizes the popular "Handwritten Digits" dataset, which contains grayscale images of digits from 0 to 9. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets to facilitate model development and evaluation.

Model Training: A custom deep learning model, tailored for Handwritten Digit Recognition, is employed for training. The model is designed to learn and recognize patterns from the pixel values of the input images.

Data Analysis: Extensive data analysis and visualization are performed on the dataset, enabling insights into its distribution, characteristics, and the relationship between classes.

Confusion Matrix: To evaluate the model's performance, a confusion matrix is generated, displaying the true labels versus the predicted labels. This matrix helps assess the accuracy and potential misclassifications of the model.

Prediction on Custom Images: The trained model can be utilized to make predictions on custom images of handwritten digits. Users can upload their images to test the system's ability to recognize handwritten digits outside the training dataset.

Visualization of Predictions: The predictions on custom images are showcased, along with the corresponding preprocessed normalized images and the original uploaded images. This allows users to see the transformation of their input and the model's recognition output.
